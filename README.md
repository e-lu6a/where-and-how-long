# where, and how long?

parse historical google maps timeline data to find out how long i've been,\
where.

## log

have since updated to use a local database, but haven't tried running this in a while.\ 
configuring python to run well is a doozy. 

**april 16 2024**\
commited script works, but is very slow due to nominatim request limits.\
probably need to set up offline database of geonames data, query against.\
then need to set up server; online database somewhere;\
also need to figure out how to get maps timeline data daily
